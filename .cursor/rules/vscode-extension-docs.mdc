# VS Code Docs - Relevant Rules

- Activation should be demand-driven (commands/events), avoid `"*"` unless necessary.
- Register commands in `activate()` and push disposables to `context.subscriptions`.
- Contribute user settings in `package.json` with `contributes.configuration`.
- Read config using `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(...)`; default scope is `window` if unspecified.
- For status bar: keep one concise, contextual item; avoid extra icons/colors.
- Keep `deactivate()` for cleanup; return a Promise only when cleanup is async.
- Define all defaults and constants in a single location to enable easy maintenance and future configurable defaults.
