# TypeScript Clean Mini

- Prefer explicit, strict types; avoid `any` unless unavoidable.
- Replace magic values with named constants when reused or non-obvious.
- Keep functions single-purpose; extract repeated logic.
- Use comments only for intent/constraints, not obvious behavior.
- Do not swallow errors; handle or report them clearly.
