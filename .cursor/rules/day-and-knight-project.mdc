# Day and Knight Extension

## Project Summary

VS Code extension that auto-switches themes based on **local time** (day vs night). Differentiator: supports **arrays of themes** with random assignment, rather than single `workbench.preferredLightColorTheme` / `workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme`.

## Key Conventions

- **Config keys**: `day-and-knight.light-themes: []` and `day-and-knight.dark-themes: []` — we own these, not workbench.*
- **Theme application**: Extension directly updates `workbench.colorTheme` (and related workbench settings)
- **Requirement**: `window.autoDetectColorScheme: false` — otherwise VS Code's built-in OS-based switching conflicts with our time-based logic
- **Status bar**: Provides quick toggle between day/night themes
- **Tech**: TypeScript, VS Code extension API

## Reference

Similar extension: [vscode-sundial](https://github.com/muuvmuuv/vscode-sundial) — we differ by supporting theme arrays + random selection.
