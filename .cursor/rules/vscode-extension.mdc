# Day and Knight - Core Rule

- Build only a VS Code extension.
- Focus entry point: `src/extension.ts`.
- Use `day-and-knight.lightThemes` and `day-and-knight.darkThemes` as source of truth.
- Do not use `workbench.preferredLightColorTheme` or `workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme` for inputs.
- Write selected theme to `workbench.colorTheme`.
- Require `window.autoDetectColorScheme: false` to avoid OS-based conflicts.
- Keep changes small, local, and TypeScript-first.
